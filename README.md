# Spatial-Crimes-Analysis

Goal - The project uses extensive spatial data analytics to understand the growing nature of crimes in Berkeley and find insightful patterns in their distribution. It also sets out to go one step further and provide analytics-based recommendations to tackle crimes in Berkeley.

Analysis - The preliminary analysis looks to find patterns in where Berkeley crimes occur within the city, their time and day of occurrence and the different types of crimes. Next, a more detailed analysis ensues, which utilises intensity mapping to locate the most crime intensive areas in Berkeley, followed by finding a correlation between the crimes and the Berkeley BART stations.

Recommendation - The goal of the recommendation phase was to pinpoint the optimal location of the Berkeley Police Department based on the distribution of crimes. This is done by utilizing ‘distance optimality’ to all the crimes in Berkeley. This gave us the prospective location for a future Berkeley Police Department that has the least average distance to all the crimes in Berkeley. 
Once completed, the final step was to optimise this prospective police department location even more by giving special emphasis to the schools within Berkeley that are most affected by crime. The crimes around these schools were given higher weight and the optimal location for the Berkeley Police Department was recalculated with this new model.

Conclusion - The police department in a city is pivotal to the city's safety, and this project looks to contribute towards reducing the increasing crimes in Berkeley. The project successfully found 'crime hotspots' in Berkeley, clustering of crimes around Berkeley BART stations, and was able to successfully pinpoint the optimal location for a prospective Berkeley Police Department based on average distance to all crimes.
